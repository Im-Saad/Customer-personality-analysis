The problem statement is to segment customers based on their demographic and the amount they spend on products. 
This will help in gaining a better understanding of their customers' personalities and habits. 
The analysis is based on a dataset from Kaggle.

Tech Stack:
•	Jupyter Environment
•	Pandas
•	Numpy and Scipy
•	Scikit-Learn
•	Seaborn
•	Matplotlib

Firstly, I did exploratory data analysis. I used the categories age, income, marital status, education, total children, and amount spent on products for this. 
The EDA was carried out in three phases:
•	Univariate Analysis
•	Bivariate Analysis
•	Multivariate Analysis

After analysis I used KMeans to make a model for segmenting the customers. I used medians to interpret the results as mean can be very sensitive to outliers
